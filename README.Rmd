This package is complimentary to a report which analyses data from simulated guppy experiments, collected via the software Simbio.

# Install and load data

```
# Model simplification

The analysis files are stored in `/analysis` (these are ignored from the package build). There are various model simplifications carried out in `/analysis/predator_density.R` and `/analysis/substrate.R` in particular.

# Package functions
Man pages included for everything except `smooth_predation` which wasn't used in the final analysis.

- predict_density()
- predict_substrate()
- rgba()
- roses_unicode()
- roses_set_ggtheme()
- smooth_predation()
